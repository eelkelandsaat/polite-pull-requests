See issue #1137 

## Approach

To avoid having to modify positions of downstream tokens and such, the easiest approach that came to
mind was to check for long whitespace-bound tokens and remove them prior to running the tokenizer.

this approach replaces the excessively long tokens with the string literal ""unk"", which may not be
desired. i 

## Questions

Some things that I wasn't sure about, and thought I would mention here:

1. should anything be done to handle the pre-tokenized case? the same token length issue could arise,
   but it's less clear to me whether we should be modifying tokens that the user has already
   manually created. (long term, this could also be an argument for addressing the issue at the
   pos level, although this is probably good enough for now..)

2. since the max length check is being handled in `tokenize_processor.py`, would it make sense to
   remove that logic from `output_predictions`?

3. in `stanza.models.tokenization.utils.output_predictions`, the max_seqlen is set to `max(1000,
   max_seqlen)`, which would ignore a users specified value if it's less than 1000.. is this
   necessary? and if so, would it make sense to at least emit a warning when the user's setting is
   overriden?

another potential long-term approach you could consider would be to add another processer that gets
run before others (~""preprocessor""?..), where logic along these lines could be included and tuned by
the user.

## Fixes Issues

- #1137 

## Unit test coverage

Yes. Just a simple test with a string with length >> `TokenizeProcessor.MAX_SEQ_LENGTH_DEFAULT`

## Known breaking changes/behaviors

I hope not!

Between version 1.4.0 and dev branch as of this pull request, some optimizations were added to pass around numpy or torch items sooner.  This improved the runtime some already.  Switching to a pytorch dataloader further improves the runtime.  Timing on a 2080ti and a CPU that was top of the line a couple years ago:

```
main branch:
real    0m53.964s
user    0m51.178s
sys     0m4.205s

real    0m38.706s
user    0m46.471s
sys     0m6.985s
```

The canonicalization is straightforward. I am not allowing the values of the finite set to be parameterized right now, because ``is_pos`` is only supported for leafs but it's needed here for more complex expressions, since theoretically the set values could be something like param1 + param2. I could hack around this though if the functionality is desired.

Ran into the following bug with p-norms in DGP problems.

In particular, the below assertion fails: 

```
x = cp.Variable(pos=True)
norm_expr = cp.norm(cp.Constant([3,4]), p=2)
prob = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(norm_expr * x ** 2), [x >= 1])
solution = prob.solve(gp=True) # Correctly returns 5 
print(prob.solution.opt_val) # Incorrectly prints 5.8
assert np.isclose(prob.solution.opt_val, solution)
```

Looks like it's due to two issues:
1. In the DGP canon functions dict, the key for pnorms is the pnorm function wrapper, not the Pnorm class. 
2. Should be multiplication instead of exponentiation during the canonicalization process. 

$\ln\(||x||_p\) = \ln\(\(\sum |x_i|^p \)^\frac{1}{p} \) = \frac{1}{p} \ln \(\sum |x_i|^p\)$ 

Since we take the logs of all the leaves first and pass that in as args, we are given $z = \ln (x)$. Then, our expr becomes 
$\frac{1}{p} \ln \(\sum e^{zp} \) = \frac{1}{p} \text{log-sum-exp} (z * p)$. 

Added some tests in `test_dgp2dcp.py` for $p = 2$ and $p = 3$, as well as a matrix fro norm.

https://api.github.com/repos/cvxpy/cvxpy,1987,2022-12-26T21:53:28Z,"### Background on this PR

PR #1978 (targeting CVXPY 1.3) included bugfixes for dual variable recovery in problems with complex expressions. The fixes involved adding tuples called ``UNIMPLEMENTED_REAL_DUALS`` and ``UNIMPLEMENTED_COMPLEX_DUALS`` to the ``Complex2Real`` class. These tuples consisted of certain Constraint classes. If the type of a Constraint object belonged to one of these tuples then dual variable recovery for that Constraint would be skipped.

@SteveDiamond started the process of porting this bugfix to CVXPY 1.1 and 1.2 ([link](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/pull/1955/commits/5be035253739bf6b0a0a76a14a264e7f3831ac62#diff-06ac9467275a4f02950ff75e8cc0f196fae9c2475e68ea88beb0b80606966a5aR38-R39)). It seemed to Steven that _additional_ constraint classes were needed in these new tuples.  At Steven's suggestion I ran some tests and found that the code introduced in PR #1978 could still break. 

This led me to look into this in more detail. The result of my investigation is that changes are needed on both master (for CVXPY 1.3) as well as CVXPY 1.1 and 1.2. This PR is targeting master.

### Changes in this PR

The main change in this PR is to go through all the Constraint classes and make sure that the list returned by ``constr.get_data()`` satisfies ``constr.get_data()[-1] == constr.id``. This has long been the default behavior for the Constraint class, but it was ""lost"" in subclasses that overrode the ``get_data`` function. Such classes included ExpCone, PowCone3D, PowConeND, SOC, and the quadrature-based approximate cones (to appear in 1.3). After making this change it was possible for me to get rid of the ``UNIMPLEMENTED_REAL_DUALS`` tuple introduced in PR #1978.

Note: the change to the SOC class wasn't strictly necessary, since SOC has a dedicated complex2real canonicalizer that copies the constraint ID ([see here](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/blob/1c94aad38d961c754c7c097f66d60f7a62fe10ea/cvxpy/reductions/complex2real/canonicalizers/soc_canon.py#L22)). No change was needed to PSD because the PSD class did not override ``Constraint.get_data()``.

I also added input checks for real data to several Constraint classes. This is necessary for CVXPY 1.3 since all Constraint classes are now being exposed in CVXPY's top-level namespace.

### Are these changes really necessary?

This PR includes two new unittests in ``test_complex.py``. These tests will fail if run on master or if run on Steven's pending PR for 1.1 and 1.2 (including if you modify to account for different import structures in these branches). The tests will also fail before either my fix or Steven's version, when the repo was at [this state](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/tree/f216089ef53a8496b18643211997e00a83cef9d3).",2022-12-26T22:05:21Z,2022-12-27T06:22:16Z,2022-12-27T07:20:07Z
https://api.github.com/repos/cvxpy/cvxpy,1986,2022-12-26T20:31:45Z,"Hi -- small QOL upgrade for my personal cvxpy usage to automatically turn native matmul into quadratic forms where applicable. See issue #1762. When expressions are being constructed, then some MulExpression are automatically turned into a QuadForm, when certain criteria hold. 


Notes: 
1) Does not handle associativity. If we have a constant vector c, then `1/2 * c.T @ c @ x.T @ A @ x` is technically a quadratic form `(1/2 * c.T @ c) * QuadForm(x, A)`, but will not be converted in the below change. 
Reasoning here is that the expression tree leading up to the quadratic form can be arbitrarily tall and would require a search for the right-most leaf (to avoid QuadForms in cases like `1/2 * (c.T @ (c @ (d.T @ (d @ x.T)))) @ A @ y`).  However, as long as parantheses are included around `x.T @ A @ x`, the Expr will have a correct QuadForm leaf.  

2) Does not handle asymmetric/non-hermitian matrices. I noticed that the default QuadForm behavior currently is to throw an error if QuadForm(x, A) is called with A being asymmetric/nonhermitian. Could simply replace A with (A + A.H) / 2 but saw that was removed a while back. 

Let me know if these are not the desired behavior -- thanks! 


Best,
Jeffrey

https://api.github.com/repos/cvxpy/cvxpy,1978,2022-12-18T07:14:41Z,"@SteveDiamond @phschiele this is ready for review. Once this PR is merged we will have all the functionality I wanted ready for CVXPY 1.3. (There's still more to do, but it's reasonable to hold until CVXPY 1.4.)

### Main changes
The quadrature-based approximation of the operator relative entropy cone: ``OpRelEntrConeQuad``.
* This constraint class now accepts Hermitian input. Previously, it only accepted symmetric input.
* The ``TestOpRelConeQuad`` class  in ``tests/test_cone2cone.py`` has been rewritten.

The ``von_neumann_entr`` atom.
* This now accepts Hermitian input. Previously it only accepted symmetric input.
* The ``Test_von_neumann_entr`` class in ``tests/test_von_neumann_entr.py`` has been rewritten.
* Since its introduction into cvxpy's master branch,``von_neumann_entr``'s default canonicalization codepath has used PSD + ExpCone constraints. It also had the option of using a quadrature-based approximation technique to remove the ExpCone constraints and replace them with more PSD constraints. This reformulation was very inefficient. This PR makes it so that if the user provides approximation parameters to ``von_neumann_entr``, then the ExpCone constraints will be replaced with SOC constraints.

### Bigger incidental changes

I changed the ``canonicalize_expr()`` function in ``complex2real/complex2real.py``, see [here](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/pull/1978/files#diff-06ac9467275a4f02950ff75e8cc0f196fae9c2475e68ea88beb0b80606966a5aR180-R188). The change makes sure that any Constraint objects are wrapped by a list before being returned. Previously this hasn't been necessary because most other Constraint objects had canonicalizers in ``complex2real/canonicalizers`` that were called _even when their inputs were exclusively real-valued_. However, that existing approach has a longstanding bug where someone using ``ExpCone`` or ``PowCone3D`` _anywhere_ in a model with complex-valued expressions would result in an error.

That change isn't sufficient to address all bugs. I added a ``REAL_DUALS_IMPLEMENTED`` attribute to the ``Constraint`` class. It defaults to True, but I've set it to False in a handful of classes: ``PowConeND`` and both quadrature-based approximation cones. This change should be propagated to earlier CVXPY releases, since it amounts to a bugfix for models that use ``PowConeND` alongside complex expressions.

### Small incidental changes
* The trace atom now recognizes that the trace of a Hermitian matrix (or a real matrix) is real. Making this change involved moving the complex2real canonicalization path for trace from ``separable_canon()`` in ``complex2real/canonicalizers/aff_canon.py`` into a new ``trace_canon()`` function in ``complex2real/canonicalizers/matrix_canon.py``.
* MOSEK encounters a solver failure when testing the composite atom ``xexp(pos(expr))`` in ``test_constant_atoms.py``. I've added that atom-solver pair to the list of known solver errors, so that test won't run. It's an esoteric test, but the folks at @aszekMosek might want to investigate if the latest release of MOSEK has some numerical problems.
* I renamed the file ``utilities/eigvals.py`` to ``utilities/linalg.py``, and added some functions to the renamed file. One new function computes an orthonormal basis for the range of an input matrix. Another function computes an orthonormal basis for the orthogonal complement of the range of an input matrix.",2022-12-18T07:25:44Z,2022-12-18T07:15:13Z,2022-12-24T18:25:15Z

https://api.github.com/repos/cvxpy/cvxpy,1976,2022-12-17T21:18:48Z,"### The problem
Here is CVXPY's current code for canonicalizing a complex Variable into real and imaginary parts:
```
def variable_canon(expr, real_args, imag_args, real2imag):
    if expr.is_real():
        return expr, None

    imag = Variable(expr.shape, var_id=real2imag[expr.id])
    if expr.is_imag():
        return None, imag
    elif expr.is_complex() and expr.is_hermitian():
        return Variable(expr.shape, var_id=expr.id, symmetric=True), (imag - imag.T)/2
    else:  # Complex.
        return Variable(expr.shape, var_id=expr.id), imag
```
The parameterization of Hermitian matrices is higher-dimensional than necessary, as explained below.

> The standard representation an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix in terms of real quantities consists of an $n \times n$ symmetric part and an $n \times n$ skew-symmetric part. (Recall that a square matrix $A$ is called skew-symmetric if $A^T = -A$.)  The dimension of this representation is exactly $n^2$. However, the implementation above uses an unstructued complex variable for the imaginary part of the Hermitian matrix, which adds $n(n+1)/2$ unnecessary free parameters.

This PR resolves the above inefficiency and its downstream effects. (It's a subset of the changes originally proposed in PR #1969. That PR will be closed once this PR and a couple others are merged.)

### The solution

The first step in addressing the inefficiency above is to define ``imag = Variable(expr.shape[0] * (expr.shape[0]-1) // 2)`` when ``expr.is_hermitian()``. Then, instead of returning ``(imag - imag.T)/2`` for the imaginary part of ``expr``, we return the skew-symmetric Expression ``strict_upper_tri(imag) - strict_upper_tri(imag).T``.  This solution requires modest changes to the ``Complex2Real`` reduction defined in ``reductions/complex2real.py``.

This PR goes a step further. Its main user-facing change is a new skew-symmetric property for Expression objects.  By default, an expression ``expr`` will have ``expr.is_skew_symmetric() == False``. However, if ``expr`` is a Constant then ``expr.is_skew_symmetric()`` will be determined by inspecting ``expr.value``. One can also assert that an Expression is skew-symmetric by using a new wrap atom: ``skew_symmetric_wrap``.

The ``skew_symmetric_wrap`` atom helps with canonicalization of matrix atoms that accept complex input. When many such atoms are applied to a complex matrix $C = X + iY$ (with $X$ and $Y$ real), they canonicalize by applying a real version of the atom to the lifted representation

$$Z(X, Y) = \\begin{bmatrix} X & Y \\\ -Y & X \\end{bmatrix}.$$

This lifted representation is important because it is easy to express its singular values and singular vectors in terms of those of $C$. (This is true even when $C$ is not square!) In the special case when $C = X + i Y$ is Hermitian, we must have that $X$ is symmetric and $Y$ is skew-symmetric. It is easy to show that when this happens, $Z(X, Y)$ is symmetric, and in fact one can represent its eigenvalues and eigenvectors in terms of the eigenvalues of eigenvectors of $C$. 

This PR includes a new ``expand_complex`` function in ``complex2real/canonicalizers/matrix_canon.py`` that preserves the facts above for purposes of DCP checks. This new function replaces the old ``hermitian_canon`` function. Its main change is to check that if ``X.is_symmetric()`` and ``Y.is_skew_symmetric()``, then it forms ``Z(X, Y)`` and returns ``symmetric_wrap(Z(X,Y))``.

### Smaller changes
This PR also includes minor changes to other wrap atoms:
* It introduces a ``symmetric_wrap`` atom.
* It requires that certain DCP properties hold in order to use a given wrap. For example: ``symmetric_wrap(M)``, ``hermitian_wrap(M)``, and ``psd_wrap(M)`` now explicitly check that the provided matrix ``M`` is square.",2022-12-17T21:29:06Z,2022-12-17T21:46:08Z,2022-12-18T01:19:38Z

I adapted the same series of semi-definite approximations that I have been implementing so far for the previous `Constraint` classes to get a representation for `von_neumann_entr`. 

The API for `von_neumann_entr` remains unchanged --- if the user wants to employ this approximate formulation in their program, then they can just pass in the usual parameters for the approximation along with the input matrix, like so: `atom=von_neumann_entr(N, (m, k))`.

Some documentation in `von_neumann_entr`'s docstring still remains, but other than that, this is mostly complete!

Tiny follow up to #1888 , allowing the usage `cp.CLARABEL`.

Also just a small note on adding CLARABEL at index 0 of `CONIC_SOLVERS` in `solvers/defines.py`:
This implicitly makes CLARABEL (if installed) the default solver for supported problems. As soon as CLARABEL is being 
added as a dependency, this _could_ cause some regressions for users simply calling `.solve()`, which we should be aware of.

prob.solve()
print(""First solve time:"", prob.solver_stats.solve_time)

The _Operator Relative Entropy_ is defined as so:

$$
D_{\text{op}}(X||Y)=-X^{1/2} \log(X^{-1/2} Y X^{-1/2}) X^{1/2} 
$$

The corresponding ""Full"" Operator Relative Entropy Cone is defined as follows:

$$
K_{\text{re}}^{n}=\text{cl}\\{(X,Y,T)\in {\mathbb{H}}_{\scriptsize{++}}^{n}\times \mathbb{H}_{\scriptsize{++}}^{n}\times \mathbb{H}^{n}: D_{\text{op}}(X||Y)\preceq T\\}
$$

The PR implements a well motivated approximation to the above set, where instead of working with the non-commutative perspective of the negative logarithm, we operate over an approximate proxy for the same (which is defined in terms of two key ideas i.e. an integral representation of the logarithm and the functional equation: $\log(x)=\frac{1}{h}\log(x^h)$ ), and hence; instead, we observe the epigraph of the non-commutative perspective of this approximate construction.

The current implementation is largely complete. Web documentation is still needed and the implementation needs to support complex (i.e., actually Hermitian, rather than symmetric) inputs.

Support for generic handling of the perspective transform has been a longstanding issue dating back to pre 1.0 days. We (@phschiele  and I) use the fact that the perspective transform of a function with a given graph form is trivially obtained. We implement this functionality as a new atom called `perspective` which takes in a (convex) scalar expression `f ` and a nonnegative affine scalar `s`. Under the hood, the canonicalization computes `f`'s graph form, adds the new variable `s`, and represents the perspective of `f` by returning the epigraph variable `t`.

For further reference on the graph form perspective rule, see @moehle's [paper](https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0167691115001747).

This is still a work in progress and we hope to get some feedback on the general implementation idea. We provide extensive tests for problems involving the second order cone, the exponential cone, the power cone, and the psd cone. There is still some minor additions: dealing with concave functions, grad, elementwise capability, but we think the core functionality is there.

This PR adds support for the quadratic objective + conic constraints standard form currently supported by SCS.

Main changes:
- Updated cone_matrix_stuffing and dcp2cone to handle quadratic objectives.
- Added ``has_quadratic_term`` to check if an objective expression is compatible with the quadratic objective + conic constraints standard form.
- Added some logic to construct_solving_chain to follow the new canonicalization path when appropriate.

Canonicalization is only altered for problems that use SCS (or another conic solver that supports quadratic objectives) and have an objective with a quadratic term. In theory all conic problems could use the new canonicalization path, but I didn't want to risk performance regressions. I also added a new solver argument for SCS that can force cvxpy to use the old canonicalization path.

Always compare `expression.id` instead of (implicitly) `hash(expression)` for variables and parameters.
Issue link (if applicable): #1827 

TODO:
A question remains if cvxpy should always be two instances to be the same if they have the same `.id`.
E.g. what is the expected behavior of the following (a similar example can be constructed for parameters):

```py
    x = cp.Variable(nonneg=True)
    y = copy.deepcopy(x)

    obj = cp.Minimize((x + y))
    prob = cp.Problem(obj)
    prob.solve()
```
There are also the `.copy()` functions, which do not deepcopy the leaves, presumably for this very reason.
Should `deepcopy(expression)` be generally discouraged?

This PR attempts to bring a new backend to CVXPY that no longer relies on CVXCORE.
I.e., the code in `lin_ops/parser.py` should contain all functionality currently in the C++ code.
Preliminary testing shows that it is usually faster when no/few parameters are involved. 
For problems with many parameters, the stacking of 2D sparse matrices is slow. A follow-up with ND-sparse libraries is in progress.
The main idea is to make this feature `opt-in` now to get more feedback on its performance in different applications.
Issue link (if applicable): #1521

Some questions @cvxpy/maintainers:
1. What's the best way to pipe the backend choice through? Obviously, the current implementation is just for demonstration
2. What about testing? For development, I added a special flag that would test all backends and ensure the result is the same across backends, but I was not sure if we would like to have such a flag exposed.

TODOs:
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Remove some code duplication
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Regression tests (i.e., running all tests under the new backend)

https://api.github.com/repos/cvxpy/cvxpy,1833,2022-07-21T18:45:39Z,"In this PR, I add support for the scalar relative entropy cone via the approximation method that was defined in Theorem-3 of [THIS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00812). 

The sREC also happens to be directly connected (under a permutation and sign change of the arguments) to the exponential cone, and @rileyjmurray added a method for conversion from `ExpCone` to `ExpConeQuad` to that end. 

As it stands now, the biggest shortcoming in the current state of the PR, are two things:
1. Lack of support for elementwise application of `ExpConeQuad` to vector variables --- this is due to the usage of the `quad_over_lin` atom for implementing the semidefinite approximation (currently, one of the test cases has been explicitly modified to make it pass)
2. Lack of proper experimentation for arriving at a sensible set of defaults for the parameters $(m,k)$ in the approximation --- while $m$ is related to the quadrature approximation used in the procedure, $k$ doesn't lend itself to any kind of an obvious intuitive interpretation.

There's also some documentation missing, but I will add that in the next few commits.

https://api.github.com/repos/cvxpy/cvxpy,1803,2022-06-13T22:32:10Z,"## Description
This PR implements the `dotsort` atom.
While @ericlux and I were looking at a weighted _generalization_ of `sum_largest`, @stephenpboyd pointed out that this is in fact a _special case_ of `dotsort`, i.e., $\langle sort\left(vec(X)\right), sort\left(vec(W)\right) \rangle$.

A derivation for `sum_largest` is given e.g. in example 2.7 [here](https://docs.mosek.com/modeling-cookbook/linear.html#weak-and-strong-duality). I'll note that the implementation of `sum_largest` uses a different notation in the dual, which makes translating from this reference to the implementation a bit confusing. In the PR description and implementation, I will stick to the notation used in `sum_largest`. A reference for the implementation (in Julia) can be found [here](https://github.com/jump-dev/Convex.jl/blob/e3ca4249495b836e437043f37f34d86163297ef2/src/atoms/lp_cone/dotsort.jl).

One can think of extending the primal form of `sum_largest` to 

$$ \begin{split}\begin{array}{ll}
\mbox{maximize}      &  x^TZw \\
\mbox{subject to}    &  0\leq Z_{ij}\leq 1, & i=1,\ldots,n, j=1,\ldots,k,\\
                     &  \sum_i Z_{ij} = 1, & i=1,\ldots,n,\\
                     &  \sum_j Z_{ij} \leq 1, & j=1,\ldots,k
\end{array}\end{split} $$

When this problem is solved, $Z$ is used to assign the largest value of $w$ to the largest value of $x$, etc.. I.e., it will look something like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44360364/173454206-1c8b20d1-55c9-4882-9cac-ab042bb56136.png)

The dual looks like this and thus allows to have non-constant $x$:

$$ \begin{split}\begin{array}{ll}
\mbox{minimize}   & \sum_j q_j +\sum_i t_i &      & \\
\mbox{subject to }& t_i+q_j         & \geq & w_j * x_i, & i=1,\ldots,n, j=1,\ldots,k\\
                  & t_i           & \geq & 0, & i=1,\ldots,n,
\end{array}\end{split} $$

I have left some implementation details as comments in the code below.

https://api.github.com/repos/skulpt/skulpt,1419,2022-03-24T10:58:49Z,"In cpython import lib checks a module's spec to see if it's initializing
If it's initializing then a `""most likely due to a circular import""` error message is thrown.

We don't have specs in skulpt.
Instead, I add a `.$initializing` attribute to modules before we eval them.
Since a `relativePackage` is responsible for importing its leaf modules, I add the same attribute to the `relativePackage` (if it's not already in the initializing state).

I added the Circular Import tests from Cpython and tweaked them slightly.
Most tests failed because skulpt thought there were circular imports going on that weren't
That seemed to be because the `relativePackage` didn't know anything about the module it was importing early enough.
To fix this I add the module as an attribute to the `relativePackage` at the same time we put it in `sys.modules`
If the import fails, at the same time as removing the module from `sys.modules`, I also remove the module from the `relativePackage`'s attributes.

Since our internal `tp$getattr` implementations are supposed to return `undefined`,
To ensure that the `""most likely due to a circular import""` error message is thrown, I adjust the `sk$attrError()` callback.
This gets called from compile code to throw a somewhat correct `AttributeError`.

In the compile code I also removed a fixReseverd call, which was no longer needed (and actually a little bit broken) since the names for __import__ get converted to `Sk.builtin.str` when  we do `tp$getattr` and `tp$setattr`. Keeping it around meant relative modules would have a `_$rw$` in their python name.

Finally I adjust the `testunit.js` file - since it didn't support packages.

The **[final commit](https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt/commit/993e19bdfe1511b7191c128bbfc25ee5baf95112)** in this pr is the one that's worth looking at, since that's where the changes are made. The bulk of the changes are in int.js.
- commit 1 - minor formatting and a small tweak to the int slots (minor cosmetic changes)
- commit 2 - copy and paste cpython tests into our test suite.
- commit 3 - update JSBI (our BigInt polyfill) to the latest version, which includes bug fixes
- commit 4 - adjust the cpython tests for skulpt and fix the issues that arose.

---

**Some of the bug fixes:**
- pow didn't work for negative bigints
- round wasn't correctly implemented for bigints
- division for bigints where both ints convert to inf as floats but their division results in a finite float. 
- comparisons with floats and bigints
- bit xor/or/and for integers larger than `2**31` might give the js value rather than the python value.
- domain error not thrown for math log functions when `x = 0`.

Note - we have two versions of the `JSBI.BigInt` polyfill. We use native `BigInt`s under the hood if they are available and if we're in an older browser we use the `JSBI` library as is.

https://api.github.com/repos/skulpt/skulpt,1343,2021-07-21T12:42:14Z,"This pr does a few things
1. changes the flag `sk$acceptable_as_base_class` to `sk$unacceptableBase` 
2. Allows Errors to support multiple inheritance close #1342 
3. Uses the cpython approach to construct python Error classes
4. Replaces all `NotImplementedError`s with `NotImplementedImportError` for our stdlib stubs close #1341 
5. Don't cache modules in sys.modules that raise exceptions

### 1. `sk$acceptable_as_base_class` -> `sk$unacceptableBase`
it seems better to have a positive flag here based on the context it's checked
It's a relatively new flag and internal so this shouldn't be breaking
See `type.js` for when this is checked.

### 2. Allows Errors to be support multiple inheritance
adds a flag `sk$solidBase` which all builtin native classes are assigned by default
layout conflicts in the `type.js` `best_base` function are checked against this flag.
This can be overridden when building a native class. Which is what the Exception classes now do.

### 3. Uses the cpython approach to construct python Error classes
See cpython's exceptions.c
They have 3 subclass creator functions `ComplexExtendsException`, `SimpleExtendsException` `MiddlingExtendsException`.
We take a similar approach and construct the Exceptions this way.
The exceptions constructed by `simpleExtends` can be subclassed with other similar exceptions.
The major change in this pr is `errors.js`.

### 4. Replaces all `NotImplementedError`s with `NotImplementedImportError` for our stdlib stubs
We might break code if we change the Error type. But using multiple inheritance works well.
(as suggested in this https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt/pull/276#issuecomment-850090989)
It's a very common pattern to catch an `ImportError` and use a fallback so we should support that.


### 5. Don't cache modules in sysmodules that raise exceptions
This is consistent with cpython's importlib
At the moment in skulpt you can import a not implemented module but only get the error the first time you try to import.
All subsequent times you get the cached import
This could be bad if you have fallback imports
The next time you try to import the module you'd get the cached module rather than the fallback 😬

It only affects the repl and doesn't affect running in the browser.
It also only affects devbuild and not build.

The cause of slowness was from commit 6100446677f755384c64e4ec3bae30ed068688b4 which added `var` before `$compiledmod`. 
Removing the `var` also fixed the slow speed of repl.js.
Adding `""use strict"";` before `var $compiledmod` also fixed the speed.
(but we can't add `""use strict"";` because of the way skulpt handles local variables in compiled python functions)

I only found this fix because `Sk.importMainWithBody` was fast in `repl.js` and experimenting with a few differences between `Sk.builtin.exec` and `Sk.importMainWithBody` I stumbled across using `Sk.global[""eval""]` instead of `eval`. Which doesn't make sense to me because they are the same object.

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

That's because not all the methods are overridden for ordered dict 
so things in `ordered_keys` are not set for certain methods
We could extend the ordered dict to override all the necessary methods (basically all of them).
or we could just remove `ordered_keys` and let ordered dict use dict (which is now ordered).

The benefits of this approach is reducing the code size.

We then only need to override the 3 methods that are different `$r`, `tp$richcompare`, `move_to_end`.

Implement keyword extraction feature and unit test. (#145 )
The engine has two options, namely 'keybert' and 'frequency' for KeyBERT and naive frequency ranking respectively.
KeyBERT is an algorithm to rank keywords by cosine similarity between embedding of each ngram in a document to embedding of the whole document. Embeddings are produced by a large language model. I use `airesearch/wangchanberta-base-att-spm-uncased` in this work.
The original implementation has more variety to rank keywords. Please check https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT for more details and better explanations 🙂 . I'm re-implementing core features and making it support Thai.

```python
from pythainlp.summarize import extract_keywords

text = (
    ""เบียร์ เป็นหนึ่งในเครื่องดื่มแอลกอฮอล์ที่เก่าแก่ที่สุดและบริโภคกันอย่างแพร่หลายมากที่สุดในโลก ""
    ""และเป็นเครื่องดื่มยอดนิยมอันดับสามทั้งหมด รองจากน้ำดื่มและชา ""
    ""ถูกผลิตขึ้นโดยการกลั่นเบียร์ (brewing) และกระบวนการหมักของแป้ง ซึ่งส่วนใหญ่ได้มาจากธัญพืช - ""
    ""ส่วนมากมาจากมอลต์ข้าวบาร์เลย์ แม้กระทั่งข้าวสาลี ข้าวโพด ข้าว และข้าวโอ๊ตก็ใช้ได้เช่น ในช่วงขั้นตอนการกลั่นเบียร์ ""
    ""กระบวนการหมักของแป้งนั้น น้ำตาลในวอร์ต(wort)จะก่อให้เกิดเอทานอลและคาร์บอนเนชั่นในเบียร์ที่ได้ออกมา ""
    ""เบียร์สมัยใหม่ส่วนใหญ่จะกลั่นด้วยฮอปส์ ซึ่งจะเป็นการเพิ่มความขมและรสชาติอื่น ๆ ""
    ""และทำหน้าที่เป็นสารกันบูดและสารคงตัวตามธรรมชาติ สารแต่งกลิ่นรสอื่น ๆ ""
    ""เช่น กรู๊ต สมุนไพรหรือผลไม้ซึ่งอาจจะรวมทั้งหรือการใช้แทนฮอปส์ ในการกลั่นเบียร์เชิงพาณิชย์ ""
    ""ผลของการเกิดคาร์บอนเนชั่นตามธรรมชาติมักจะถูกขจัดออกในช่วงกระบวนการผลิตและแทนที่ด้วยการอัดลมด้วยคาร์บอนเนชั่นแบบบังคับ""
)

keywords = extract_keywords(text)
# output: ['wort)', 'brewing)', 'ที่เก่าแก่', 'ขจัดออก', 'อัดลมด้วย']

keywords = extract_keywords(text, engine='frequency')
# output: ['เบียร์', 'กลั่น', 'คาร์บอน', 'เนชั่น', 'เครื่องดื่ม']
```

### What was wrong

Just a brand new feature.

### How this fixes it

Fixes #145 

Some issues related to `airesearch/wangchanberta-base-att-spm-uncased`. It's spamming warning messages upon init.
```
- This IS expected if you are initializing CamembertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing CamembertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of the model checkpoint at airesearch/wangchanberta-base-att-spm-uncased were not used when initializing CamembertModel: ['lm_head.decoder.weight', 'lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.decoder.bias', 'lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_head.bias']

`. I checked TCC from @bact think PyThaiNLP's TCC regex doesn't cover that case and I found we forget `C์ ` rule from `<Cons> <TCC1> <Karan>` rule. The `<TCC1>` can be `NULL`. It mean ก์ should be 'ก์'.

**Update**: I found many `<Karan>` rules are missing and I added `<Karan>` rules.

Fix incorrectly word_tokenize-d  numeric data formats such as time, comma-separated numbers, decimal number, and ip address.

### What was wrong

For some tokenizers (esp. neural nets), numbers separated with symbols (. , :) are tokenized into multiple parts. They should be atomic.

**Example**:
```
""12:34pm"" -> [""12"", "":"", ""34pm""]
```

### How this fixes it

Postprocess the tokenized tokens with regular expression.
`r""(\d+[\.\,:])+\d+""`: digits followed by either "".,:"" once, possibly repeated, and ended with digits.

Fixes #652

`word_detokenize` is Thai word detokenizer that merge list to string with whitespace.

Rules:

- [x] Add whitespace between number/other language and Thai words.
- [x] Add whitespace between ๆ (Thai iteration mark) and Thai words

Example
```python

## News

> Since PyThaiNLP 3.0, We will end supporting PyThaiNLP on Python 3.6. Python 3.6 users can use PyThaiNLP 2.3.2.

> We have updated the Thai word dictionary & rule for newmm. We recommend retraining your model if you use newmm for word tokenization in your model.

## What is new?

### Deprecation and other API changes

- Deprecated syllable_tokenize. `syllable_tokenize` is deprecated, use `subword_tokenize` instead
- `pythainlp.tag.named_entity.ThaiNameTagger` is change to `pythainlp.tag.thainer.ThaiNameTagger`. This old class will be deprecated in PyThaiNLP version 3.1.

### Augment
- Add Thai Text Augmentation

### Corpus
- Fix lots of misspellings in the dictionary (words_th.txt)
- Add get_corpus_default_db and thainer 1.5 model. You can add corpus on `default_db.json`, and you don't load the last trainer model from the Internet.

### Tag
- Add TLTK (pos_tag and ner) - add TLTK wrapper to pythainlp functions ex ner, word_tokenize and more.
- Add NER class - `NER` class for Named-entity recognizer tasks.

### Translate
- Add `pythainlp.translate.Translate` Class
- Add Chinese-Thai Machine Translation
- Add Thai-French Machine Translation

- Tokenize repeating dots and commas from numbers (fix #461)
- Retrained sentenceseg_crfcut.model for PyThaiNLP 2.4
- Add SEFR CUT to pythainlp
- Add TLTK (sentence_tokenize and word_tokenize) - add TLTK wrapper to pythainlp functions ex ner, word_tokenize, and more.
- Add nlpo3

### Transliterate
- Refactor Royin Transliterate: Avoid embedded if blocks and simplified consonant replacing operations
- Manually merge update-royin branch with dev branch to add O-ANG rule
- Add TLTK (g2p and ipa) - add TLTK wrapper to pythainlp functions ex ner, word_tokenize, and more.
- Add pythainlp.transliterate.puan

### Word Vector
- Fix token_max_len bug that makes it always zero
- Add `pythainlp.word_vector.WordVector`

### Spell
- Add more spelling engine
- Add TLTK (spell) - add TLTK wrapper to pythainlp functions ex ner, word_tokenize, and more.

### Generate
- Add pythainlp.generate to generate a text.

### Tool
- Add misspell module

### Other
- Add TLTK - add TLTK wrapper to pythainlp functions ex ner, word_tokenize, and more.

Upgrade to nlpo3-python v1.2.2 to fix issue when using a dictionary file with blank lines.
See https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/nlpo3/issues/51

### What was wrong

Trim function was previously unable to handle a string with only whitespaces.
This makes an error when it got a string with only one ""newline"" char in it (from a blank line in a text file).

### How this fixes it

Update to nlpo3-python 1.2.2 where it already got fixed.

https://api.github.com/repos/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack,638,2022-11-03T10:15:20Z,"Falling back to unvendored installs is an anti-feature. In general this is the tool saying ""I know you have explicitly requested to do X, but now that this has failed I will do the exact opposite of what you requested"". In general, when a user explicitly requests X and this fails the correct course of action is to provide an error message.

Specifically:

* When vendored installs fail, unvendored installs will often also fail, but   may fail for different reasons. Example: build dependencies may not be available in the buildpack. This sends the user off on a wild goose chase (fixing the second problem, rather than the original one)

* When unvendored installs will in fact not fail (i.e. the intention of the now-removed code) the user's expectation that whatever is in the ""vendor"" directory is what's actually installed is violated. This violates reproducability of installs, and opens a can of worms security-wise (e.g. the vendored packages may have been scanned previously, whereas arbitrary downloads are generally not).

History: The anti-feature was introduced in https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/commit/518f933f15deb7bf8973796ea0dac54f36250b14, without providing
reasoning why this is desirable.

* [Quickstart example is included in the examples folder](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls/tree/update-example-server/examples/hello-world) with configs for _more than just VSCode_.
* Existing examples have had ""vscode"" added to their folder names.
* README now contains an [Alternatives](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls/blob/update-example-server/README.md#alternatives) section.
* A [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls/blob/update-example-server/HISTORY.md) file has been added that relates the inception of Pygls.
* Some folder structure changes. Most notable `pyodide_testrunner` is under tests now.

It turns out the `workspace/configuration` request requires a `WorkspaceConfigurationParams` object, rather than a plain `ConfigurationParams` object. 

This PR
- Fixes the `AttributeErrors` seen in the various `get_configuration_xxx` commands in the example json extension, as well as adding test cases to cover them going forward. 
 - Fixes the type annotations in the various `get_configuration_xxx` methods in the pygls codebase
- Updates the documentation to match

Includes deprecation warning for old method signature

I don't know if I'm being too clever here?

Also, does anybody know why there are often 2 public methods to do the same thing like this? Therefore, we can call both `pygls.server.LanguageServer.publish_diagnostics` and `pygls.protocol.LanguageServerProtocol.publish_diagnostics`. I assume it's because `pygls.server.LanguageServer` is the more friendly user-facing class, whilst `pygls.protocol.LanguageServerProtocol` is internal and has to be comprehensive.

I think in #274  we said we wanted to make the `name` and `version` arguments to a `LanguageServer` object mandatory?
This PR removes the warning and default arguments meaning they now have to be provided by the language server author.

This came up in #293 where a missing feature was identified in the current release, but is fixed in the v1 alpha release. Whereas we're only _probably_ ready to release v1, we're _definitely_ ready to recommend it for new projects. 

Missing feature notes:
Strictly, Pygls only currently supports LSP v3.15, but this feature was added in 3.17. Ideally we wouldn't mix and match features from different versions. Ideally we should wholesale support a version. Anyway, we're soon to release a breaking change version of Pygls that follows Microsofts own Python LSP types #273.

Fixes #293

Here's an initial attempt at a migration guide for the 1.0 branch.

- The table of renamed types and constants was manually generated so I may have missed some and there could be errors.
  There's a also a few types I couldn't find obvious replacements for (I probably didn't look hard enough) so some help reviewing this table in particular would be appreciated :slightly_smiling_face: 
- Have I missed anything obvious?

This fixes the construction of the `workspace.fileOperations` fields of the server's capabilities by passing through the `FileOperationRegistrationOptions` provided when registering features like `WORKSPACE_DID_DELETE_FILES`

This also resolves [the issue](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls/pull/273#issuecomment-1301546322) I was having with the runtime type checking of the given options

All errors other than LSP requests are now sent to the client as `showMessage.type = MessageType.Error` messages. This may result in existing custom LSP servers showing errors that were not seen before, these aren't new errors, just previously undisplayed errors.

Another advantage to this is that it is now easier to test error handling. When running end to end tests, all errors are now accessible in the client.

Also, `JsonRPCProtocol.data_receieved()` now catches unhandled errors.

Currently the restriction on pydantic does not allow us select a single version that works for python 3.7-3.11. This PR removes the upper bound on python version <3.11. This allows pygls to select a single version of pydantic that works on all python versions.

Close #274

## Description (e.g. ""Related to ..."", etc.)

Although we discussed the possibility of mandating these arguments in #274, this PR does not make the new `name` and `version` arguments of the constructor of class `LanguageServer` mandatory.  So, it can be merged to the current master before the release of v1.0.0.

When the name is not set, the server still sends the serverInfo as null.  I'm not sure that's the right thing to do.  I can update the code to omit the serverInfo field altogether in this case.  What do you think?

⚠️ This involves breaking changes. Existing projects depending on Pygls will need to update their code. Testers are welcome.

You can try it by explicitly setting your dependency to `pygls=1.0.0a2`. The migration guide is at: [docs/pages/migrating-to-v1.rst](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls/blob/v1-lsprotocol-breaking-alpha/docs/source/pages/migrating-to-v1.rst)

`lsprotocol` is mostly just a module that officially and comprehensively defines the data structures and types that make up the LSP specification. Therefore, what it offers are upstream (from Microsoft, the creators of LSP) guarantees on adherence to the formal behaviour and expectations of the specification. 

TODO:
* [x] ~~Write~~ Publish guide on how to make the required changes.
* [x] Isolate a commit in a sample LSP server project that demonstrates the changes. Eg; [jedi-language-server already has a PR](https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server/pull/230/commits). Or maybe make a verbose commit in the new [""Pygls Starter project""](https://github.com/tombh/cli-tools-lsp) I'm working on.
* [x] Get feedback from people that have successfully made the migration:
  * https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server/pull/230.
  * https://github.com/charliermarsh/vscode-ruff/pull/37
* [x] @alcarney what else would you like to see happen before the final release?
* [x] Remove advice to start new projects with v1 alpha

This may also be a good opportunity to introduce other breaking changes, such as in #274

Notes:
* Issues that this release should either address or fix:
  * #221
  * #243 
  * #234 
  * #101
  * #275
* See [the original ""lsprotocol"" PR](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls/pull/264) for further discussion.

**Note:** While the test appears to work as intended, due to running the server in a separate thread I'm unable to reproduce the exact error I see in the original issue. I instead get a different error about there not being an event loop.

Hi!  I found myself re-writing slight variations of `Document.word_at_position` for ""words"" which aren't alphanumeric, but allowing regular expressions to be passed to the method in question means I can re-use it.  So this PR just adds a couple of parameters to `Document.word_at_position`.

Hopefully the exact behaviour should be clear from the docstrings.

The new parameters have default values set to the previous hard-coded patterns so I think this should be fully backward compatible with the same behaviour.

Thanks! :slightly_smiling_face:

Closes #238 

TLDR: I have the existing `pygls` test suite running but failing in a Pyodide environment and thought it's probably at a convenient place to start getting some feedback. :smile:  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2675694/173125496-5b1612f4-6907-4b56-baff-062c06fcd15b.png)

----

After doing some more research towards #238, I came across [this issue](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/1791) in the pyodide repo that basically says as long as your tests are packaged, you can use `pytest` from within pyodide. 

Running with this idea, this PR implements a proof of concept pyodide test suite for `pygls`, with the following workflow.

1. Build a local wheel containing `pygls` and its test suite.
1. Copy the wheel into the new `pyodide_testrunner/` folder
1. Spin up a local `http.server` pointed at the `pyodide_testrunner` folder
1. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser, the tests should start running once pyodide has bootstrapped itself.

In order to get this running in CI I'm assuming we'd be able to script steps 1-3 and stand up a headless browser session somehow (selenium?) as a replacement for 4.

Now for some notes on the implementation.

---

The implementation breaks down into three main steps/commits

- Rename `tests/` -> `pygls_testsuite/`.

  This is purely to get the test suite included in the wheel when packaging, I don't particularly care about this step so happy to change it back/tweak packaging rules/include it as a sub package of `pygls` - whatever we decide the best approach to be 

- Add proof of concept test runner

  The `pyodide_testrunner/` folder contains just enough glue code to get the tests loaded and executing under pyodide.

  - It runs the tests in a web worker to keep the web page responsive while the tests run.
  - It overides `sys.stdout` in the pyodide environment so the test output can be redirected to the DOM - a nice to have but not necessary for the tests to run.
  - Invokes pytest using the [`--pyargs`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/usage.html#specifying-which-tests-to-run) option, which is what allows us to load tests via the `pygls_testsuite` package

- Attempt to provide `ClientServer` implementation for pyodide

  Up til now everything has worked suprisingly well! Unfortunately upon running the test suite for the first time everything errored out as the `ClientServer` object used to drive the majority of the test suite relies on threads - which are not available in pyodide!

  So this final commit is a (failing) attempt at providing an implementation of `ClientServer` compatible with the pyodide runtime.
  It works on the same principal as the glue code in the exmaple web extension from #218, but it doesn't quite work yet and I'd like to see if anyone has a better way we can handle this. - See code comments

- What doesn't work?
  
  There is a mismatch between the arguments being passed to `send_request` and what the pyodide implementation expects.

  ``` 
  I think this is because the pyodide implementation is bypassing the parsing machinery in `pygls` and is expected to be given objects - not sure if this is a good thing or not...

Related to the recent flakey timeout errors we've been seeing on Windows CI runs, I discovered that when a test randomly raises a `TimeoutError` the test server could not be stopped, thus preventing the entire test suite from exiting, and ultimately preventing us from seeing the underlying problem.

This commit does not resolve any reasons why a test might occasionally exceed its timeout, but it does allow the test suite to exit, which then allows us to identify problematic tests.

However, the current WIP fix does not work on Windows! But at least it's a step in the right direction as CI is actually exiting and giving us an error now, namely that Windows more often than not does not raise `TimeoutError` even when set to `1e-50` seconds.

Any ideas welcome...

I am still new to the project, so I may not have the full story. But it
started with a somewhat far-reaching merge to remove defaults from all
serialisable fields in the API: #198. This had the knock-on effect of
regressing progress notifications, as reported by @MatejKastak in #217.
One of their suggestions is to not use `exclude_unset=True`. Some months
later @dimbleby suggested that `exclude_none=True` would also fix the
issue[1]. Considering those 2 suggestions, let's replace
`exclude_unset=True` with `exclude_none=True`.

Update dependencies.

I had intended just to pick up the 1.9.0 release of pydantic; but then while I was here, why not also update all the other things too?

I also shuffled mypy configuration so that it all happens in a single file, which seems to me less confusing than spreading it across two (one of them hidden).

And then, because I was double-checking that the sphinx upgrade didn't break anything, I fixed a couple of typos and a missing reference in the docs.

With the recent releases of [github.dev](https://github.dev/openlawlibrary/pygls) and [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/github/openlawlibrary/pygls) I wanted to see if it was possible to use [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) to have a `pygls` powered language server running in a web browser. - Turns out it is! :smile: 

It's worth noting that due to the `multiprocessing` module [not being available](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/wasm-constraints.html#included-but-not-working-modules) in Pyodide, `@server.thread()` methods will not work in the browser, but so far everything else appears to work.

This PR makes the few tweaks required to get `pygls` running in a browser context (see commit messages for details) as well as adding a new example extension that demonstrates how to get a simple language server up and running in a web version of VSCode.

This isn't quite ready to be merged yet as ~`mypy` isn't happy about the import from Pyodide's `js` module and~ I should probably update the docs with some notes on Pyodide, but I thought I'd open it now so that there's an opportunity for feedback :smile:

- Update `LSP_METHODS_MAP` so that semantic token methods now accept just the `SemanticTokensLengend`
- The remaining fields of `SemanticTokensOptions` are computed in `ServerCapabilitiesBuilder` based on which features are present.
- If a legend is passed to multiple semantic token methods, only the first is used.

This replaces all references to `localhost` with `127.0.0.1`.

I've verified this locally this as a patch to the conda-forge feedstock, which builds under Docker: I'm not a huge Docker fan, but it is _a thing_, and it seemed like updating the docs along with the tests might save someone some trouble in the future.

pygls 0.11.0 serializes certain optional fields, regardless of whether the server has explicitly set them - or whether the client has declared support for them.

Updating [jedi-language-server to take pygls 0.11.0](https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server/pull/151) I see that we are now returning various fields that we previously didn't eg on `CompletionItem` we always set `deprecated` and `preselect`.  I'm pretty sure that this is wrong: not least, there are `deprecatedSupport` and `preselectSupport` on `CompletionClientCapabilities`: if the client has not declared support for these things then presumably we're not supposed to return them.

The approach I have taken is to remove all defaults for Optional fields:
- when the default was not `None`, this had the effect of making the field not optional after all, as above
- when the default was `None` it was redundant to declare it as such, so it's just more compact not to bother

This pull request partially undoes f248002a2fb8a10fb9a5d2bd5a0160a04a6189aa.  I'm not sure what the motivation for that was, but flagging it in case I've broken something.

This fixes #187.

By raising the exception stored in the future and then handling it `sys.exc_info()` is able to see the exception and provide the details which can then be logged. With this change I now see a detailed traceback in the log.
```python

Introduce GitHub Actions for CI. This will run all tests and linting on each PR and push to the repository.

It will also build the example JSON extension as appropriate. This required introducing an ESLint configuration file which checks for errors and common mistakes.

Fixes #173.

I agree with recent comments saying that receiving an empty header at readline tells you that you're done: per <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects>

> If the end of the file has been reached, f.read() will return an empty string ('') ...
> ... if f.readline() returns an empty string, the end of the file has been reached ...

So that's what this does.

If this looks good, I wonder whether it's time for a 0.10.3 release?  There have been a handful of bug fixes that it would be nice to see published.

Avoid setting fields in server capabilities to `None`, because explicitly setting them causes pydantic to serialize them, which is not what is wanted.

The reason I couldn't do this:

```python
class JsonRPCRequestMessage(JsonRpcMessage):
    """"""A class that represents json rpc request message.""""""
    id: Union[int,str]
    method: str
    params: Any
```

is that in the case of `Union`, `pydantic` tries to convert the input to the first valid type, so, if you pass `id='1'`, an object will have a field of type `int` `id=1`...

Related to #139 (and this pull request is against that branch).

I have:

- allowed pydantic and typeguard versions to go higher.  typeguard declares that it follows semantic versioning, so 2.x should be safe.  pydantic seems to make breaking changes at minor releases; however 1.8 works just fine so I've allowed 1.7.x and 1.8.x

- tweaked `ClientCapabilities.has_capability()` along the lines I suggested in https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls/pull/139#issuecomment-798347921 ie added a type annotation, and allowed it to return a default value.  I've also renamed it to `get_capability()`, since it handles not only boolean values (eg `text_document.completion.completion_item.documentation_format` is a list of `MarkupKind`).",2021-03-15T00:57:13Z,None,2021-03-15T13:50:40Z

It looks like we were using the wrong function from `aiohttp` to parse streaming bodies. Instead of `rbody.iter_chunks()` we should be using `async for line in rbody` instead. See docs here: https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/streams.html#asynchronous-iteration-support.

This change immediately fixed the issue in my code.

These libraries add up to 146MB, which makes it challenging to deploy applications using this library in environments with code size constraints, such as AWS Lambda.

Since the primary use case of this library (talking to the OpenAI API) doesn’t generally require data libraries, it’s safe to make them optional. The rare case when the data libraries are needed in the API client is handled through assertions with instructive error messages. 



## Requirements before

Installing `openai-python` requires the `numpy`, `pandas`, and `openpyxl` data libraries that add up to 146MB:

```bash
$ pip install -e .
$ du -sh $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python*/site-packages/
167M	/Users/jakub/.virtualenvs/openai-python/lib/python3.11/site-packages/
```


## Requirements after

Installing `openai-python` doesn’t require the data libraries by default, **resulting in ~7 times smaller aggregate size of dependencies:**

```bash
$ pip install -e .
$ du -sh $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python*/site-packages/
23M	/Users/jakub/.virtualenvs/openai-python/lib/python3.11/site-packages/
```

Data libraries can be installed manually using the new `datalib` extras, if needed:

```
$ pip install -e .[datalib]
$ du -sh $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python*/site-packages/
167M	/Users/jakub/.virtualenvs/openai-python/lib/python3.11/site-packages/

$ pip install -e .[embeddings]
$ pip install -e .[wantdb]

KeyError occurs when running `openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f training_file.jsonl` when `training_file.jsonl` contains a prompt/completion that is BOTH a duplicate and a long example. Without trying to change too much, this fix would:
- wrap the retrieval of `long_examples` and `long_indexes` into a function, calling it preemptively within `long_examples_validator` to provide analysis information about how many rows are long examples, then calling it when actually dropping rows within `optional_fn` and providing info to the user if the keys that are being dropped have changed. 

### Related Issue
Fixes #121 

### Other Notes
I am also happy to provide a file that can be used to reproduce this error.

### Example Output:
When the error would normally occur, instead you would see:
```
❯ openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f training_file_0927.jsonl
Analyzing...
- There are 2 duplicated prompt-completion sets. These are rows: [5, 6]
- There are 2 examples that are very long. These are rows: [3, 6]
Based on the analysis we will perform the following actions:
- [Recommended] Remove 2 duplicate rows [Y/n]: y
- [Recommended] Remove 2 long examples [Y/n]: y
The indices of the long examples has changed as a result of a previously applied recommendation.
The 1 long examples to be dropped are now at the following indices: [3]
- [Recommended] Add a suffix separator ` ->` to all prompts [Y/n]: y

- Support `openai.api_key_path` variable to make it easy to have long-running processes with auto-updated keys.
- Drop support for unverified SSL connections.
- Substantially simplify HTTP client code. Now that we use `requests` for everything, we do not need distinct `HTTPClient` and `APIRequestor` abstractions, and we can use the `requests` implementation for multipart data, rather than our own.

- Drop support for `APIResource.delete` as an instance method; it is just a class method now.
- Drop support for `APIResource.save`; use `APIResource.modify` instead. This substantially simplifies API resources, since they no longer need to track changed fields, and there's less risk of race conditions.

some of my code recently started failing with this exception after a Python version bump:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/amaranth/hdl/xfrm.py"", line 209, in on_statement
    new_stmt = self.on_Assign(stmt)

    gen_rhs = f""({(1 << len(stmt.rhs)) - 1} & {gen_rhs_value})""
ValueError: Exceeds the limit (4300) for integer string conversion
```

Here's a small reproducer:

```python
from amaranth import Module, Signal, sim
dut = Module()
dut.d.sync += Signal(1).eq(Signal(1) << Signal(14))
sim.Simulator(dut)
```

This fails because the generated code uses a large mask value, which raises an ValueError during decimal formatting in Python versions that include a mitigation for CVE-2020-10735. Formatting to hexadecimal instead avoids the algorithmic complexity and is not impacted by the new conversion limits.

I'm not sure if this is worth merging as affected modules are already near the [existing value limits](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth/blob/db49294cf722e9463666bd06f81a86f930b8707c/amaranth/sim/_pyrtl.py#L75) enforced by pyrtl, so feel free to close/reject this patch ^^

This also simplifies the logic used in emitting RTLIL overall.

Combinatorial processes are still emitted however. Without these the RTLIL does not have a high-level understanding of `Switch` statements, which significantly diminishes the quality of emitted Verilog, as these are converted to `$mux` cells in Yosys, which become `?` constructs when converted back to Verilog.

https://api.github.com/repos/amaranth-lang/amaranth,575,2021-01-13T00:26:02Z,"This PR adds support for the internal high-speed oscillator on MachXO2/XO3L devices, called OSCH. Migen had support for the oscillator, but nMigen doesn't have it yet.

It essentially replicates the changes that https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen/pull/530 made on Intel Cyclone V devices and https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen/pull/338 on the iCE40, with the difference that MachXO2/XO3 devices have a configurable frequency and a list of allowed freqs, as opposed to the Cyclone V which has a fixed frequency with a maximum of 100MHz, and the iCE40 which uses a fixed 48MHz oscillator and a divider.

This PR is accompanied by (and would allow) PR https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen-boards/pull/136 in nmigen-boards, which changes the TinyFPGAAX2Platform to use the internal clock (at 2.08 MHz) by default, since the TinyFPGA AX2 has no external clock and thus no better default alternative for the clock signal.",2021-01-13T00:28:12Z,None,2022-04-06T04:12:53Z
https://api.github.com/repos/amaranth-lang/amaranth,571,2021-01-02T23:27:14Z,"This includes a number of fixes for `{r,w}_level` in AsyncFIFOBuffered.

1. The accounting for the output register used `AsyncFFSynchronizer` instead of `FFSynchronizer`. This is wrong as we want to synchronize both edges
2. Use the proper clock domains in the tests (not really a bug in the fifo logic obviously)
3. The FFSynchronizer should have a latency of 4 to match the latency of `consume_w_bin` / `w_level`. Two cycles for the `FFSynchronizer` from the read to the write domain of `consume_w_gry`, one for the `GrayDecoder` and one for the `w_level` calculation.
4. Fix the output register accounting. If the user asserts `r_en` even if `r_rdy` is low, we get `-1` in the intermediate calculation which overflows to `1` as we have a unsigned `Signal`

Let me know if I should split this into multiple PRs or elaborate more on the fixes. The last two include additional testcases that fail without the fix. I did not include a testcase for the `AsyncFFSynchronizer` to `FFSynchronizer` change, as this is obviously wrong and would be hard to properly test without proper multi clock support in formal.",2021-01-02T23:29:46Z,None,2021-01-06T01:05:47Z
